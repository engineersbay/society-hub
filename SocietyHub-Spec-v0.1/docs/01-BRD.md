# Business Requirements Document (BRD)

**Document:** 01-BRD  
**Product:** SocietyHub  
**Version:** 0.1  
**Related:** [Vision](00-Vision.md), [PRD](02-PRD.md)

## 1. Problem

Housing societies are mini-ecosystems of residents, owners, tenants, committee members, security, housekeeping, and vendors. Despite growing complexity, most societies still run on fragmented tools:

| Activity | Typical tool today |
|----------|-------------------|
| Maintenance collection | Excel |
| Complaints | Notebook / WhatsApp |
| Notices | WhatsApp / print / email |
| Vendor details | Paper / chats |
| Visitors | Security register |

Disconnected tools cause poor visibility, delayed issue resolution, weak accountability, financial inefficiency, data loss, and resident dissatisfaction.

## 2. Business objectives

### MVP (now)

1. Digitize **complaint registration and tracking** (replace notebook/WhatsApp for issues).
2. Make complaint raise easy for residents (login + simple form + media + voice-to-text).
3. Give **Admin** visibility of all raised complaints and statuses.
4. Onboard Admin and Residents with login/logout (SSO, OTP, or PIN).

### Phase 2+

5. Enable online maintenance payments and clearer reconciliation.
6. Centralize notices with confirmation of view.
7. Reduce broader administrative work for Secretary and Treasurer.
8. Deliver a multi-tenant SaaS that can onboard societies without code changes.

## 3. Stakeholders

### Primary

- Residents
- Owners
- Tenants

### Secondary (society management)

- Society Secretary
- Treasurer
- Committee members
- Society Admin

### Operational (MVP: limited; fuller modules later)

- Security, housekeeping, vendors (directory/docs may appear; full vendor ops = future)

### Platform

- Super Admin
- Support team

## 4. Stakeholder pain points (summary)

| Stakeholder | Pain | Need |
|-------------|------|------|
| Resident | Unresolved complaints, payment confusion, missed notices | Transparency, mobile access, faster resolution |
| Secretary | Phone calls, Excel, complaint follow-ups | Automation, dashboard, reports |
| Treasurer | Reconciliation, defaulters, receipts | Online pay, auto reconcile, financial reports |
| Committee | Lack of visibility, resident complaints | Real-time dashboards, decision support |

## 5. Business impact of status quo

- High administrative effort and operational cost
- Resident dissatisfaction and delayed resolution
- Poor financial transparency and compliance risk
- Data inconsistency and weak auditability

## 6. Opportunity

A centralized SaaS platform can reduce manual effort, improve transparency, standardize workflows, increase collection rates, raise resident satisfaction, and enable data-driven committee decisions—while supporting a scalable subscription business.

## 7. Success metrics

### MVP (complaint portal)

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Residents raise complaints via portal instead of only WhatsApp/notebook | Majority of pilot issues logged in-app |
| Admin can see and act on all open complaints in one list | Yes |
| Login works via SSO or OTP; PIN available after setup | Yes |

### Phase 2+ (platform)

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Resident active usage | ≥ 80% of residents |
| Maintenance payments online | > 70% |
| Complaints resolved within SLA | > 90% |
| Manual admin work reduction | ≥ 50% |
| Multi-society readiness | Onboard new societies without code changes |

## 8. Business scope

### In scope (MVP)

Responsive web **complaint portal**: onboard Admin, onboard Resident, login/logout (SSO / mobile OTP / PIN), raise complaint (title, auto flat, type, description, voice-to-text, photos/videos), resident + admin complaint lists with status.

### Phase 2 (full society operations)

Explicitly retained from the original broad MVP (detailed FR-* in [PRD](02-PRD.md) §§6.2, 7.4–7.12):

- Full roles: Super Admin, Society Admin, Secretary, Treasurer, Committee, Resident, Tenant
- Society hierarchy + settings (SLA, billing defaults) + role assignment
- Owners/tenants, profiles, tenant verification documents
- Advanced complaints: assignment, comments, SLA reminders/escalation
- Maintenance billing (generate, dues, defaulters, corrections)
- Payments (Razorpay + cash/cheque/NEFT, receipts, history)
- Notices with read acknowledgment
- Notifications (in-app, email, web push)
- Ops + finance dashboards; audit log UI

### Out of scope (future — after Phase 2)

Visitor management, parking, clubhouse booking, staff attendance, CCTV requests, asset management, full vendor management, events, marketplace, AI assistant, builder edition, municipal extensions, native Flutter apps, WhatsApp notification channel.

## 9. Constraints and assumptions

- SMS OTP (MSG91) and Google SSO for India pilot; PIN is device/app unlock after verified identity.
- Voice-to-text relies on browser speech APIs where available.
- Deliver as a **simple responsive web app** (not a native app for MVP); UX must stay simple for non-technical users.
- Committees have limited technical expertise; UX must stay simple.
- Pilot validates product-market fit at Keshav Heights before broad sales motion.
